# RaidBot
A simple technique to raid the server (this bot is only set up for learning procedures and I am not responsible for any damages)

# Define your Discord token
You can find your discord BOT token in the developer portal on discord

# Replace server ID with the ID of the server where you want to ping
Set developer mode on discord and then right-click on the server name, which will show you a menu, then just move the cursor below and click on the "Copy Server ID" icon
